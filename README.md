# Topological Defect Signals
###### Under the supervision of [Professor Robert Brandenberger](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~rhb/) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). Funded by the [NSERC USRA](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_eng.asp) award with [FRQNT supplements](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/program/supplements-of-the-nserc-undergraduate-student-research-awards-usra-bpca-2023-2024/).

Characterization of U(1) topological defect (cosmic string) signals occuring in a class of renormalizable quantum field theories. We developed statistics to extract these signals from primordial Î›CDM background noise in 21cm cosmological observations.
