## Objective

Phase transitions in the very early universe cause spontaneous symmetry breaking events which create topological defects. Linear topological defects associated with the U(1) symmetry group are known as *cosmic strings* and create signals at high energy scales. Their presence thus is of interest to study the high energy structure of the universe.

These signals occur in a class of renormalizable quantum field theories and are stable under specific conditions on the spacetime manifold's homotopy groups. What's more is that gravitational backreaction during the early universe causes primordial


Characterization of U(1) topological defect (cosmic string) signals occuring in a class of renormalizable quantum field theories. We developed statistics to extract these signals from primordial Î›CDM background noise in 21cm cosmological observations.
