# Topological Defect Signals
###### Under the supervision of Professor Robert Brandenberger at McGill University. Funded by the NSERC USRA award with FRQNT supplements.

Characterization of U(1) topological defect (cosmic string) signals occuring in a class of renormalizable quantum field theories. We developed statistics to extract these signals from primordial ΛCDM background noise in 21cm cosmological observations.
